Consider univariate and multivariate analysis
What is univariate data?
Univariate analysis is basically the simplest form to analyze data. Uni means one and this means that the data has only one kind of variable. The major reason for univariate analysis is to use the data to describe. The analysis will take data, summarise it, and then find some pattern in the data.
Some univariate data examples are salaries of employees in a company, the number of pets in different households, length of trouts in a lake, heights of students in a certain age group.

What is Multivariate analysis?
Multivariate analysis is based in observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time. In design and analysis, the technique is used to perform trade studies across multiple dimensions while taking into account the effects of all variables on the responses of interest.
